## Personal Philosophy


## Hobbies and Interests



## Life Experiences

### Cultural Background
Growing up in China and now studying in the United States has given me a unique perspective on different cultures, educational systems, and ways of thinking. This cross-cultural experience has enriched my understanding of the world and helped me become more adaptable and open-minded.


### Countries I've Traveled To

#### United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
â˜” A rainy country, but I had the best weather during my visit â€” lucky me! Thanks, UK!
