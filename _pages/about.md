Hello! I am **Nan Li** (in Chinese: <span style="font-family: 'KaiTi', '楷体', serif; font-size: 1.2em;">黎楠</span>), a M.S. student in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ye Zhao in the [LiDAR Lab](https://lab-idar.gatech.edu/). I received my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Sichuan University](https://www.scu.edu.cn/).  

My current research focuses on **multi-robot systems**, where I develop scalable and efficient methods to address multi-agent cooperation problems. Now, I am particularly interested in applying **reinforcement learning (RL)** to design task allocation and path planning algorithms for multi-agent systems. I am also exploring how large language models (LLMs) can provide humans with better instructions in multi-robot systems.  

🚀 **I plan to apply for Ph.D. programs in Fall 2026.**  If there are opportunities, I would be very happy to connect. 🤗
