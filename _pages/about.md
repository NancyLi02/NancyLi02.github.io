Hello! I am an incoming M.S. Student in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I’ve earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Dr. Qi Lu.

## Research Interests
- Control System
- Robotics

## Research Experience
**Design and Integration of Automatic Reagent Preparation Machine** 

> Huaxi Medical Robot Research Institute **(Leader of this project)** | Sichuan University | <u>***Aug.2023-Present***</u>

+ Design specific components of the reagent machine, including the workstation for holding each component, the injection unit, and the cap processing unit
+ Use DH parameters to model the robot arm, enabling precise calculation of its position based on input joint angles
+ Employ the Monte Carlo method within MATLAB to determine and visualize the workspace of the robot arm
+ Learn the use of QT Creator to develop a user-friendly human-computer interaction interface for controlling the robot arm
+ Learn to use Arduino for interconnecting different parts of the system, facilitating communication and coordination between the reagent machine components

**A Segmented Dynamic Movement Primitives-Based Gait Assistive Strategy for Soft Ankle Exosuit** 

> Huaxi Medical Robot Research Institute | Sichuan University | <u>***Mar.2023-Aug.2023***</u>

+ Learned about the different gait planning algorithms and analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of each one
+ Grasped the DMP gait planning approach and applied it to the soft exoskeleton design
+ Made the DMP gait planning adaptable to different users by using reinforcement learning and optimization algorithms

**Singularity Free Dynamic Control Allocation for a Tilt-rotor Multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles** 

> Supervised by Prof. Qi Lu| Sichuan University | <u>***Jan.2022-Mar.2023***</u>

+ Built the barrier function to convert the inequality constraint into an equation constraint to circumvent the singularity problem
+ Introduced the equation constraint via Lagrange’s equation and converted this problem to an optimization problem
+ Proved the stability of the adaptive algorithm by using Barbara’s Lemma
+ Performed the trajectory simulation on the six-rotor tilt-rotor UAV avoidance singularity problem

# Personal

I like all kinds of sports, such as hiking, etc., plus I enjoy debating!
