*\*Equal contribution*

**Abstract**: This paper presents a novel approach to dynamic control allocation for tilt-rotor multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles, addressing the critical singularity problem that can occur during flight operations. Our method employs barrier functions to convert inequality constraints into equation constraints, effectively circumventing singularity issues while maintaining system performance.
